# BasicAPITraining

- create an API
- follow RestAPI best practices
  - Use HTTP methods
    - Example : GET /customers, POST /shipment, PUT /products/{id}, DELETE /orders/{id}
  - Use clear and consistent resource naming conventions
    - Example : /customers, /orders, /shipment, /products
  - Use HTTP status codes correctly
    - Exapmle: 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, etc.
  - Make your API stateless by design
    -  Authenticate each request with an access token rather than relying on server-side sessions.
  - Authentication
  - Make use of the proper mechanisms for authentication and authorization
    -  Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT-based authentication and define roles/permissions for authorized users.
  - Use JSON
  - Pagination
  - Versioning
    - Example: /v1/orders, /v2/customers
  - sort and filter
  - Error handling
    - To eliminate confusion for API users when an error occurs, we should handle errors gracefully and return HTTP response codes that indicate what kind of error
    - Implement error handling to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during API requests   
  - Caching
  - use HTTPS and SSL
  - Validate input parameters
  - 
- working with first code migration
- Dependenci injection
  - technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies
  - achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation
  - helps you to follow SOLID's dependency inversion and single responsibility principles
- Solid
  - class should have only one job or responsability
  - open for extention but closed for modification
  - extend OCP and enables u to replace base classes with derived ones without breaking the application 
  - interfaces with need actions for the client
  - high level dependencies should not depend on low lever, both depend on abstractions
- Unit test
  - xunit,moq, assertions
- Integration tests
  - rest client
  - json
  - xunit
